    Based in Los Angeles, Iâ€™m the Lead Developer for [Scholar Brilliance:](https://scholarbrilliance.com/) an EdTech solution for students to live a debt-free college life.

    During my first and second years of University, I developed [MyChef:](https://mychef.replit.app/) a recommendation system that provides users with healthy meals, based on their available ingredients at home. Additionally, I gathered training data for [World Engine AIâ€™s](https://worldengine.ai/) advancements in robotics.

    Currently, Iâ€™ve partnered with [aiEDU](https://www.aiedu.org/) to teach middle and high school students an introductory course to Artificial Intelligence. For more info on the course navigate [here](https://www.notion.so/Intro-To-AI-23a5314941aa80e9843ffda2877484be?pvs=21).
